Module 4 Pandas Challenge. In this repositry I have uploaded a folder called PyCitySchools which contains a pandas code file called Challenge-4-Pandas-Challnge which contains the code to make all of the tables as well as the written report. There is also a resources folder which contains the raw data files. Additionally I attached a text file of the written report. The pandas codes are annotated for ease of reading and understanding. To create the code I adapted code from class activities and lectures. Addotionally I learned the .drop(columns) function from https://www.edlitera.com/blog/posts/pandas-add-rename-remove-columns#:~:text=To%20remove%20a%20column%20from,want%20to%20modify%20our%20DataFrame. I learned to make new dataframes out of pre existing dataframes from https://sparkbyexamples.com/pandas/pandas-create-new-dataframe-by-selecting-specific-columns/#:~:text=Using%20DataFrame.,-copy()%20Create&text=Select%20the%20columns%20from%20the,DataFrame%20using%20copy()%20function.&text=Yields%20below%20output.,-Courses%20Fee%200&text=Alternatively%2C%20You%20can%20also%20use,DataFrame%20by%20selecting%20specific%20columns.
